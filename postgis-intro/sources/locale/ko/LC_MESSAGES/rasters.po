msgid "PostGIS supports another kind of spatial data type called a *raster*. Raster data, much like geometry data, uses **Cartesian coordinates** and a spatial reference system. However instead of vector data, raster data is represented as an n-dimensional matrix consisting of pixels and bands. The bands defines the number of matrices you have. Each pixel stores a value corresponding to each band. So a 3-banded raster such as an RGB image, would have 3 values for each pixel corresponding to the Red-Green-Blue bands."

msgid "Although pretty pictures such as those you see on your TV screen are rasters, rasters may not be that exciting to look at. In a nutshell, a raster is a matrix, pinned on a coordinate system, that has values that can represent anything you want them to represent."

msgid "Since rasters live in cartesian space, rasters can interact with geometries. PostGIS offers many functions that take as input both rasters and geometries. Many operations applied to rasters will result in geometries. Common ones are the `ST_Polygon`, `ST_Envelope`, `ST_ConvexHull`, and `ST_MinConvexHull` as shown below.  When you cast a raster to a geometry, what is output is the `ST_ConvexHull` of the raster."

msgid "The raster format is commonly used to store elevation data, temperature data, satellite data, and thematic data representing things like environmental contamination, population density, and environmental hazard occurrences. You can use rasters to store any numeric data that has a meaningful coordinate location. The only restriction is that for all data in a specific band the numeric data types have to be the same."

A raster tile really corresponds to a particular raster in a raster column which is a subset of a bigger raster, such as this NYC dem data we just loaded. This is because when rasters are loaded into PostGIS from big raster files, they chopped into many rows to make them manageable.  Each raster in each row then is a part of a bigger raster.  Each tile covers same size area denoted by the blocksize you specified. Rasters are sadly limited by the 1GB PostgreSQL `TOAST <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html>`_ limit and also the slow process of detoasting and so we need to chop up in order to achieve decent performance or to even store them."
